# Distributed-Systems-Mini-Project
This repository is a modification of https://github.com/saivojjala/Autonomous-Traversal.

The repository consists of the code for a 4 wheel bot with a holonomic drive system and PID controller to accurately calculate velocity at a given instant in both the presence and abscence of obstacles. Incorporation of PID controller allows for a more robust and optimized traversal. 

## Sensors Used:
* GPS
* IMU
* 2D Lidar
